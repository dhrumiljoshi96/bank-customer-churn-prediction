# Bank Customer Churn Prediction


Context:

In general, churn is expressed as a degree of customer inactivity or disengagement, observed over a given time. This manifests within the data in various forms such as the recency of account actions or change in the account balance.

Aim:

1) Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn.
2) Build a prediction model that will perform the following
   a) Classify if a customer is going to churn or not.
   b) Based on performance, choose a model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it easier for customer service to target low hanging fruits in their efforts to prevent churn.

ANN models and H2O Auto ML will be used in this project

Time Line of the Project:

1) Data Analysis
2) Feature Engineering
3) Model Building using ANN
4) Model Building and Prediction using H2O Auto ML
